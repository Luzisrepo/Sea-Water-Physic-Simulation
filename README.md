# 🌊 Sea Water Physics Simulation (Web-Based)

A real-time, interactive **sea water physics simulation** built for the web using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project offers a visually dynamic ocean surface that reacts to physics-inspired parameters and camera controls — all adjustable via intuitive sliders.

## 🎮 Features

* 🧭 Adjustable **camera speed** and **mouse sensitivity**
* 🌀 Real-time control over simulation parameters:

  * **Number of Steps**
  * **Geometry Iterations**
  * **Fragment Iterations**
  * **Sea Height**
  * **Sea Choppiness**
  * **Sea Speed**
  * **Sea Frequency**
* ⚡ Built using vanilla web technologies, no frameworks or external libraries
* 👁️ Responsive design with a clean and minimalist UI

## 🧪 Live Demo
